A simple augmented reality app to display some image recognizing using Metaio.

This will recognize specific images and display some of the different possibilities of content types to display.

Wiley-Coyote-Help -> will display an image as a bilboard
playMovie.jpg     -> Will show a transparent video as a bilboard
google.png        -> Will take you to a google website
3dglasses.jpg     -> Will show a 3d rendering of "Metaioman" (file taken from metaio example code)
